# Lab: Help Alice Get a Job

## Overview

In this lab you will do some development (yay!) to create a new controller for ACME Corp. You’ll use the Alice and Faber samples to finish a controller that generates an invitation to connect to Alice and then requests proof that she has a degree. Once everything is done, you’ll be able to go through the Alice, Faber, and ACME demo from end-to-end.

## How to Run

It’s easiest to run this lab locally with Docker so that you have access to your own code editor. However, there is a text editor that you can use with Play with Docker (and vi is also installed) so you can run this exercise in your browser. For general instructions for each, see the following:

* [Running LFS173x Labs](RunningLabs.md)

## Instructions

For this lab, you will need three terminal sessions, one each for Alice, Faber and ACME. As with the other labs, clone the ACA-Py repo in each terminal session (Play with Docker) or once when running locally:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
cd aries-cloudagent-python/demo

```

The instructions for getting started with the coding [are here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AcmeDemoWorkshop.md).

## Takeaways

Instead of just following links and running demos, in this lab you should have been coding. How did it go?

If you have a complete answer that you want to share, please submit it as PR to the
ACA-Py repo, demo folder called "acme_complete.py". If you do that, make sure you use sign your commit for DCO ([DCO - Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/apps/dco)),
by adding the "-s" option to your commit. Hyperledger requires all commits to be signed before they can be merged.

Here's a link to an [out-of-date, completed version of `acme.py`](https://github.com/ianco/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/agent_workshop/demo/acme.py). Probably not much help, but you can look!

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
